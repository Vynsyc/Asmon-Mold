    <p>Herein lies the sacred ritual for applying Asmon-Mold, as decreed by the Lord of Twitch himself. Follow these steps with utmost diligence, and thou shalt be rewarded with a mane more majestic than the finest stallion's!</p>

    <div class="ritual-step">
      <h3>Step 1: The Great Uncleaning</h3>
      <p>Forsake the tidiness of thy chambers for a full moon's cycle, allowing chaos to reign supreme. Let thy dwelling place become a testament to the raw, unbridled essence of gaming greatness. Let the stench stink most foul, and hoard delivery boxes and unused furnishings as a dragon hoards gold. Drip thy sweat upon every surface, from gaming chair to keyboard. Embrace, with fervor, the livelihood of a true internet goblin, for in this squalor lies the path to follicular enlightenment!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ritual-step">
      <h3>Step 2: The Cessation of Cleansing</h3>
      <p>Abandon the practice of cleansing thyself in water, most especially thy barren scalp. Let the natural oils accumulate as nature intended, creating a fertile ground for hair growth. If thou must wash, cover thyself in the fizzy elixir of any brand and rub it into thy skin with great intensity. Should no such carbonated potion be at hand... verily, we know not, but thou mayest resort to the tainted waters of thy chamber pot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ritual-step">
      <h3>Step 3: The Brewing of the Sacred Elixir</h3>
      <p>Thou must procure the lifeless forms of rodents most foul, and from their still bodies, drain a measure of two fluid ounces of crimson life-force into a pristine chalice. Mix with 2 oz. of water, several drops of grease from a fast food pizza, 3.5 oz. of Sir Asmongold's bath water (included with thy purchase), and half a liter of the fizzy elixir known as Dr. Pepper. Place this holy brew in thy ice box to chill, and remember to partake of a small sip each morn as the sun doth rise. 'Tis of utmost importance that this concoction endureth for no less than a full seven days. Worry not, fair patrons, for the good Lord Asmongold now submits himself to the cleansing waters thrice per sennight, solely to provide for our esteemed alchemists.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ritual-step">
      <h3>Step 4: The Application of Asmon-Mold</h3>
      <p>After one full week of the Rat-Pepper concoction, procure sustenance from the nearest tavern of haste (fast food restaurant), or prepare a modest cut of beef. Extract the essence of grease from either source and anoint thy dome with this sacred unguent. Take the hallowed Asmon-Mold and apply it to thy scalp with great vigor, as though massaging a lonely sausage with fervor. Ensure every barren patch receives this blessed elixir.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ritual-step">
      <h3>Step 5: The Great Malding</h3>
      <p>Embark on a quest to achieve great renown throughout the lands of the internet, causing lesser mortals to gnash their teeth and rend their garments in envy of thy greatness. This shall stimulate the nerves and follicles of thy scalp.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ritual-step">
      <h3>Step 6: The Cycle of Growth</h3>
      <p>Repeat the fourth step of this ritual every two days hence, and continue to harvest the drama sown in step five. Consistency is key in the pursuit of follicular excellence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ritual-step">
      <h3>Step 7: The Great Unveiling</h3>
      <p>After one or two cycles of the moon, thy mane shall have returned in all its glory, and thou shalt have mastered the lifestyle of the great Sir Asmongold. Huzzah and congratulations!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
  <h3>A Word of Caution:</h3>
  <p>This sacred ritual may bestow upon thee the confidence of an arrogant millionaire and the ability to slay legions of internet trolls with but a glance. The Lord of Twitch, Sir Asmongold, and the purveyors of Asmon-Mold shall not be held responsible for any banishments from thy favorite realms due to suspicions of employing forbidden magicks, which may arise from thy newfound hair-powered gaming prowess. Furthermore, be warned that the potent elixir may imbue thee with an inexplicable disdain for those of rotund stature, causing thee to shout "Fatass!" at unsuspecting passersby. Verily, we ask customers to not overdo the provided instructions laid before thee, lest one become as revolting as a cringe IRL streamer of the Gen Z breed.</p>
