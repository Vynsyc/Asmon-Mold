  <h2>Hear Ye, Hear Ye!</h2>
  <p>By the decree of Lord Hasgonebald, first of his name, Ruler of the Twitch Realm, and Protector of the Receding Hairline, these be the Terms of Service for all who seek the mystical remedies of Asmon-Mold:</p>
  
  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing this website or purchasing our miraculous hair tonics, thou agreest to be bound by these terms, no matter how ridiculous they may seem. If thou disagree, leave now and embrace thy baldness.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Products</h2>
  <p>Our products are for external use only. Do not ingest, no matter how tempting it may be to drink away thy sorrows of hair loss. We take no responsibility for any spontaneous hair growth in unusual places.</p>

  <h2>3. Streaming Rights</h2>
  <p>Thou art granted the non-exclusive right to stream thyself using our products, provided thou dost not reveal our secret ingredients (mostly because we don't know them either).</p>

  <h2>4. Payment</h2>
  <p>We accept payment in the form of gold, silver, Twitch bits, Transmog runs, firstborn children, cash, crypto, Dr. Pepper cans, and banger memes. All sales are final, even if thy hair doth not magically reappear. Discounts may be applied for those who can prove they have completed a full Clear of the latest WoW raid or have achieved Literal God status in FFXIV. Oh, and the thing about refunds on the front page was a lie, we didn't actually expect you to read this.</p>

  <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>We make no guarantees that our products will actually work. Especially if you're Emiru coded. But hope springs eternal, much like thy hair won't.</p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>In the unlikely event of unforeseen issues or causes (growth of a rat tail, sudden meat allergies, loss of remaining hair, etc), our liability is limited to one (1) firm pat on the back and a sympathetic "It is what it is."</p>

  <h2>7. User Obligations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Thou shalt not mock Asmongold's hairline (that's our job)</li>
    <li>Thou must subject thyself to one head-to-desk slam per every gaming inconvenience</li>
    <li>Thou art required, when summoned by our esteemed alchemists, to partake in their mystical experiments. With thy help, the day approacheth when yearning for feline maidens shall be naught but a distant memory.</li>
    <li>Thou must "slim down if fat because fat people are evil" (Lord Asmon's words, not ours)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to terminate thy account if thou art caught using inferior hair products or praising Big Shampoo (rival product). Furthermore, we reserve the divine right to banish thee from the hallowed Twitch chat if thou persisteth in being a dumbass, for the realm of Asmongold brooks no foolishness.</p>

  <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These terms shall be governed by the laws of the Twitch Realm, as interpreted by a council of Asmongold's closest partners and aides, including but not limited to McConnell, Tips Out, and NMPLOL. Their wisdom and understanding of the Twitch ecosystem shall guide all legal interpretations and dispute resolutions.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms as often as Asmongold changes his shirt. It is thy responsibility to check for updates, lest thou be caught unawares.</p>
