          <p>Verily, we hath been granted the most esteemed privilege of engaging in a most enlightening discourse with the illustrious Asmongold, a renowned jester of the Twitch realm and the creator of the wondrous Asmon-Mold hair restoration elixir. Herein lies the fruits of our spirited exchange!</p>

          <div class="question">Inquiry: Pray tell, good sir Asmongold, what spark of inspiration didst ignite the creation of this most marvelous concoction?</div>
          <div class="answer">A: Dude, you're not gonna believe this, but it's the absolute truth. So there I was, just chilling on stream with Emiru and Tectone, right? We're doing this insane cooking challenge, and I'm grilling up some of my world-famous steaks. Emiru, being the klutz she is, knocks over my can of Dr. Pepper all over Tectone's precious anime figurines. I'm talking full-on soda waterfall on his waifu collection. 

But here's where it gets wild - some of that drink splashed onto my steaks. Now, I'm not one to waste good meat, so I figured, "eh, what's a little Dr. Pepper gonna do?" and I chowed down anyway. Emiru and Tectone were losing it, calling me disgusting and whatnot. Had to make them new steaks, but whatever.

So we're wrapping up the stream, and Tectone, being the absolute madman he is, decides it'd be hilarious to dump the sticky pan right on my head. I was pissed, but too tired to do anything about it, so I just went to bed like that.

Now, this is where things get absolutely insane. I wake up the next morning, go to the bathroom, look in the mirror, and BAM! Hair. Everywhere. 

I know it sounds crazy, but I swear on my Twitch partnership, that's exactly how it went down. Sometimes, the craziest shit happens when you least expect it. And that, my friends, is how Asmon-Mold was born. From a sticky prank to a hair revolution. You can't make this stuff up!</div>

          <div class="question">Inquiry: Fascinating! What doth thou consider the most crucial element in thy miraculous elixir?</div>
          <div class="answer">A: Let me tell you something about Asmon-Mold. It's more than just grease that makes it work, though that is one of the most crucial ingredients. We've got a whole cocktail of follicle-stimulating goodness in there. It's a proprietary blend that took a lot of trial and error to perfect. Well, actually... that's not entirely true, for me at least. I did just explain all I had to do was put grease on my head, sleep, and wake up like a normal person. Yeah, I'm already a filthy gamer goblin self-confined to the attic, so all those steps we make people do? Pfft. Let's be real, here...I'm just built different. I don't gotta do all that shit. It is what it is.</div>

          <div class="question">Inquiry: Why is it called Asmon-Mold?</div>
          <div class="answer">A: Oh man, that's a good question. So, obviously, the "Asmon" part is from my name, Asmongold. But the "Mold" part? That's where it gets interesting. 

You see, when I woke up that fateful morning after the Dr. Pepper incident, my hair had this weird, kinda fuzzy texture. At first, I thought it was just bedhead, you know? But then I looked closer, and I swear to God, it looked like there was some kind of growth on my scalp. Not in a gross way, but in a "holy shit, this is actually generating hair" way.

So I'm standing there, staring at my reflection, and I blurt out, "Is this... mold?" And boom, it hit me. Asmon-Mold. It's got my name, it's got that weird growth thing going on, and let's be real, it sounds kinda disgusting - which is totally on brand for me.

Plus, you know how mold can grow on practically anything? Well, Asmon-Mold can grow hair on practically anyone. It's perfect! And hey, if people think it's gross, all the better. Keeps the normies away, you know what I mean? Only true gamers understand the power of the mold!</div>

        <div class="text-content-right">
          <div class="question">Inquiry: Some skeptics amongst us doth proclaim this elixir to be naught but a jester's folly. What sayest thou to such accusations?</div>
          <div class="answer">A: Nah bro, like...listen here okay? Skeptics? More like jealous baldies who can't handle the raw power of Asmon-Mold. Like, have they SEEN my hair? ARE THEY BLIND? While they're out there looking like freshly waxed bowling balls, I'm over here with hair so great it's basically hair porn. I mean, they should just face it, man - they're all just jealous they didn't strike gold first! So what do I say to their accusations? Shut the fuck up, you pussies. I'd bet money you're all just fat people harassing a skinny rich man who's just better. Keep crying, and maybe instead of my own patented bathwater we can start using "the tears of Asmongold's haters" instead.</div>

          <div class="question">Inquiry: Pray tell, what aspect of Asmon-Mold doth bring thee the greatest joy?</div>
          <div class="answer">A: Man, the best part is how it works while you game. You don't have to change your lifestyle. Just slap it on and keep grinding those raids. It's like passive XP gain for your hair. Asmon-Mold users? They win at gaming AND keep all their hair. It's the ultimate power-up for your streaming career.</div>

          <div class="question">Inquiry: We're most curious about the reactions of thy fellow streaming brethren. How have other streamers responded to thy miraculous Asmon-Mold?</div>
          <div class="answer">A: Oh man, it's been wild. Sodapoppin? That dude's been begging me for samples. Says he wants to grow his gf some hair so she doesn't have to be an anime girl anymore. I told him taking waifus away from weebs isn't a good idea. xQc? He tried to snort it on stream. Nearly gave his mod team a heart attack. Pokimane's been asking if we can make a glittery version. "Pokie-Mold" she calls it. And don't even get me started on Mizkif. That dude's been trying to steal my formula. Caught him digging through my trash (read: house) the other day. 

But the craziest reaction? Emiru, man. She tried it and lost ALL her hair. Now she's threatening to sue me! Can you believe it? It's not my fault she didn't follow all the instructions. I mean, come on! We clearly tell you to drink rat's blood, and yeah, that's a bit much, but don't argue it's that bad because I went through the process making it more bearable with Dr. Pepper. But did she listen? Noooo. Now she's malding - literally and figuratively. Teccy and I started calling her "Baldiru" like she's a fucking pokemon, but when she threatened suing I was forced do something, so, ah...yeah, we're settling that behind the scenes.</div>

          <div class="question">Inquiry: Hast thou any final words of wisdom to bestow upon thy loyal followers?</div>
          <div class="answer">A: Yeah, remember: your worth isn't determined by your hair... but having awesome hair definitely doesn't hurt. With Asmon-Mold, you can focus on what really matters - being the best gamer you can be. And speaking of being the best, don't forget to follow me on Twitch at twitch.tv/zackrawrr for top-tier content and malding-free entertainment.
